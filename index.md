<h2 id="About">About</h2> 
<hr>
I have expertise in machine learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning, foundation models, and data privacy. Currently, I am focused on my venture, Elementera, where we are developing an enterprise framework designed to comprehensively facilitate AI adoption for small to medium-sized businesses from start to finish.

Before Elementera, my focus was on creating large-scale industrial machine learning systems using advanced reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques.

I earned my PhD from <a href="https://rl.cs.mcgill.ca//">Reasoning and Learning Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca//">McGill</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/people/doina-precup/">Doina Precup</a>.

During my studies, I pioneered the development of privacy-preserving reinforcement learning algorithms and initiated the first generation of membership inference attacks against off-policy reinforcement learning systems.
